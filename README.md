#Todo

###Todo is a Chrome extension that allows you to keep track of your todo list items and see your progress as you complete them.

###Features

    Add items to your todo list
    Remove items from your todo list
    Mark items as completed
    See a progress bar showing how many items are completed and remaining for the day

###How to use

To use the Todo extension, click on the extension icon in the top right corner of your Chrome browser. This will open the Todo popup window.

In the Todo popup window, you can add new todo items by typing them into the input field and pressing the "Add" button. You can remove items from the list by clicking the "x" button next to the item. You can mark items as completed by clicking the checkbox next to the item.

The progress bar at the top of the Todo popup window shows the percentage of items that are completed. The label next to the progress bar shows the number of completed items and the total number of items.

###What we did

We created a Chrome extension using JavaScript and HTML. The extension uses a list to store the todo items and has functions for adding, removing, and marking items as completed. We also created a progress bar that updates as the todo list changes.

We added basic styling to the extension using CSS to make it look more aesthetic. We also added some interactivity using event listeners, such as the form submission event and the click event for the checkboxes and buttons.

Overall, the Todo extension is a simple tool that can help you stay organized and keep track of your tasks.
